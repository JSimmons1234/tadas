@(profiles: Seq[Profile], form: Form[Profile])(implicit messages: Messages)


@* the template file is like a function and therefore it can have expected arguments
in this case it is expecting a collection of CD's for us to display
it also expects a form of type CD
then we have the implicit messages in the second set of arguments
the implicit messages is required for the form helper to build up the form
due to the plays ability of supporting internationalisation *@

@main("CDs") {
    <div class="container">
    @* Some HTML code to list out the CD's that we passed in a table with two columns *@

    <h1>Profiles</h1>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr><th>Name</th><th>Price</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        @for(profile <- profiles) {
            <tr><td>@profile.name</td><td>@profile.price</td></tr>
        }
        </tbody>
    </table>



    @* helper.form basically replaces the need for you to define the form in HTML
    we start by using the helper.form and inside the parentheses we define where this form
    will be posted to
    after that we define the input text fields to which we pass the form which was passed by the
    controller method and define that this inputText field is the name field which we need for our CD case class
    additionally we are able to pass other fields for when the text field is created so that the HTML for it
    would have a specific id and a class set
    if you don't want to define the additional fields then you can just pass the form and to which case class
    field this maps to
    lastly we have a button to actually submit this form *@
        <div class="Card">
    @helper.form(routes.Application.createProfile()) {
        @* an example of how we can pass additional arguments for the helper
        in this CD example having '_showConstraints -> false will hide the requirement Required *@
        @helper.inputText(form("name"), '_label -> "Name", '_showConstraints -> false)
        @helper.inputText(form("price"), '_label -> "Price" , '_showConstraints -> false)
        <button type="submit">Create Profile</button>
    }
        </div>
@*        @b4.vertical.form(routes.Application.index) { implicit vfc =>
            @b4.email( fooForm("email"), '_label -> "Email", 'placeholder -> "example@mail.com" )
            @b3.password( fooForm("password"), '_label -> "Password", 'placeholder -> "Password" )
           @b3.checkbox( fooForm("remember"), '_text -> "Remember me", 'value -> true )
           @b3.submit('class -> "btn btn-default"){ Sign in }
        }*@
    </div>
    @* This helper will generate the HTML for this form and it will look like this
    <form action="/cds" method="POST">
    <dl class=" " id="name_field">
    <dt><label for="name">Name</label></dt>
    <dd>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" value="">
    </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl class=" " id="price_field">
    <dt><label for="price">Price</label></dt>
    <dd>
    <input type="text" id="price" name="price" value="">
    </dd>
    </dl>
    <button type="submit">Create CD</button>
    </form> *@
